The script I use to release many devices at once for YAAP  
Makes use of https://github.com/idoybh/makeBuild (by default)  
Would require a lot of edits to use for other projects - sharing it anyways  
You're on your own in figuring out how to use this one. The docs on makeBuild are detailed enough
